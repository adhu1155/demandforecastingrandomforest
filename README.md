Demand Forecasting using Random Forest
A predictive model to forecast monthly revenue growth for a UK-based online fashion retailer using historical sales data.

In today's tough retail world, knowing how much money a store will make in the future is super important. That's why we're working on a project to predict how much money a UK online fashion store will make each month. We're using fancy math and data analysis to create a smart system that looks at past sales to guess how much money the store will make in the future. Our goal is to give the store owners helpful information so they can make smart choices about how to run their business and where to spend their money.

Revenue forecasting helps businesses in many ways:
  Guides budgeting, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
  Helps businesses adapt strategies, find new opportunities, and avoid risks.
  Using data for forecasting improves customer experiences, product choices, and profits.
